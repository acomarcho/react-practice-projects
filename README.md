# react-practice-projects
A repository for (weekly) React projects so I can keep improving my skills.

# Project 1
A portfolio site based on https://inovatik.com/mark/index.html. Original template uses Bootstrap, remade in vanilla CSS while tinkering around with SCSS.

Try it out at https://react-practice-project-1.netlify.app/.

Uses the package 'react-icons' and 'react-animate-on-scroll'.
